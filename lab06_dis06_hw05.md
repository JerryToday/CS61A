# Mutability Iterators

* Mutability
Some objects in Python, such as lists and dictionaries, are mutable, meaning that their contents or state can be changed. Other objects, such as numeric types, tuples, and strings, are immutable, meaning they cannot be changed once they are created.

```python
def insert_items(lst, entry, elem):
    """Inserts elem into lst after each occurrence of entry and then returns lst.

    >>> test_lst = [1, 5, 8, 5, 2, 3]
    >>> new_lst = insert_items(test_lst, 5, 7)
    >>> new_lst
    [1, 5, 7, 8, 5, 7, 2, 3]
    >>> test_lst
    [1, 5, 7, 8, 5, 7, 2, 3]
    >>> double_lst = [1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 3]
    >>> double_lst = insert_items(double_lst, 3, 4)
    >>> double_lst
    [1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 4, 3, 4]
    >>> large_lst = [1, 4, 8]
    >>> large_lst2 = insert_items(large_lst, 4, 4)
    >>> large_lst2
    [1, 4, 4, 8]
    >>> large_lst3 = insert_items(large_lst2, 4, 6)
    >>> large_lst3
    [1, 4, 6, 4, 6, 8]
    >>> large_lst3 is large_lst
    True
    >>> # Ban creating new lists
    >>> from construct_check import check
    >>> check(HW_SOURCE_FILE, 'insert_items',
    ...       ['List', 'ListComp', 'Slice'])
    True
    """
    "*** YOUR CODE HERE ***"
    j = 0
    for i in range(0,len(lst)):
        if (lst[i+j] == entry):       
            lst.insert(i+j+1,elem)
            j=j+1
    return lst 
```

* Iterators
设计模式是应用OOP思想的23个范例,Iterators是其中之一.OOP放在Iterators后面?
An iterable is an object where we can go through its elements one at a time. Specifically, we define an iterable as any object where calling the built-in iter function on it returns an iterator. An iterator is another type of object which can iterate over an iterable by keeping track of which element is next in the iterable.

```python
def count_occurrences(t, n, x):
    """Return the number of times that x appears in the first n elements of iterator t.

    >>> s = iter([10, 9, 10, 9, 9, 10, 8, 8, 8, 7])
    >>> count_occurrences(s, 10, 9)
    3
    >>> s2 = iter([10, 9, 10, 9, 9, 10, 8, 8, 8, 7])
    >>> count_occurrences(s2, 3, 10)
    2
    >>> s = iter([3, 2, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 4, 4, 5, 5, 5])
    >>> count_occurrences(s, 1, 3)
    1
    >>> count_occurrences(s, 3, 2)
    3
    >>> next(s)
    1
    >>> s2 = iter([4, 1, 6, 6, 7, 7, 8, 8, 2, 2, 2, 5])
    >>> count_occurrences(s2, 6, 6)
    2
    """
    "*** YOUR CODE HERE ***"
    count = 0
    while n > 0:
        n -= 1
        if(next(t)==x):
            count += 1
    return count
```

* generator
We can define custom iterators by writing a generator function, which returns a special type of iterator called a generator.

A generator function has at least one yield statement and returns a generator object when we call it, without evaluating the body of the generator function itself.

When we first call next on the returned generator, then we will begin evaluating the body of the generator function until an element is yielded or the function otherwise stops (such as if we return). The generator remembers where we stopped, and will continue evaluating from that stopping point on the next time we call next.

As with other iterators, if there are no more elements to be generated, then calling next on the generator will give us a StopIteration.

```python
def filter_iter(iterable, f):
    """
    >>> is_even = lambda x: x % 2 == 0
    >>> list(filter_iter(range(5), is_even)) # a list of the values yielded from the call to filter_iter
    [0, 2, 4]
    >>> all_odd = (2*y-1 for y in range(5))
    >>> list(filter_iter(all_odd, is_even))
    []
    >>> naturals = (n for n in range(1, 100))
    >>> s = filter_iter(naturals, is_even)
    >>> next(s)
    2
    >>> next(s)
    4
    """
    "*** YOUR CODE HERE ***"
    for i in iterable:
        if f(i):yield i
```

```python
def hailstone(n):
    """Yields the elements of the hailstone sequence starting at n.
       At the end of the sequence, yield 1 infinitely.

    >>> hail_gen = hailstone(10)
    >>> [next(hail_gen) for _ in range(10)]
    [10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1]
    >>> next(hail_gen)
    1
    """
    yield n
    if n == 1:
        yield from hailstone(n)
    elif n % 2 == 0:
        yield from hailstone(n // 2)
    else:
        yield from hailstone(n * 3 + 1)
```

```python

    """Generates all permutations of the given sequence. Each permutation is a
    list of the elements in SEQ in a different order. The permutations may be
    yielded in any order."""
    if not seq: yield []
    else:
        for p in perms(seq[1:]):
            for i in range(len(seq)):
