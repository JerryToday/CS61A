# control flow

* expression
expression consist of operand ang operator.The most important property is closure.That's means a very complicated expreesion itself also can be a operand or operator.
The bool expression evalue to True or False.so control statement using bool expreesion to control which branch would be executed.
* statement
A statement is tell computer what to do.For instance,a  def statement creates ("defines") a function object and binds it to a name.Assignment statements, such as x = 3, define variables in programs.

Python's operator module defines binary functions for Python's intrinsic arithmetic operators. For example, calling operator.add(2,3) is equivalent to calling the expression 2 + 3; both will return 5.

``` python

    5
    >>> a_plus_abs_b(-1, 4)
    3
    >>> a_plus_abs_b(-1, -4)

    if b < 0:

    else:
